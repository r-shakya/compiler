#compiler
##introduction
- As part of our Compiler design Laboratory Course we have developed
a fully functional Compiler which takes .txt file as input and gives
assembly( .s ) file as output.
- In this project We have developed a new
programming language and then we have designed a compiler for it
in different phases.
